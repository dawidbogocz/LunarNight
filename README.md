A Minecraft like game in Unity


The project explores the development of an infinite, procedurally generated game world,
focusing on the Unity engine. The research demonstrates the possibility and efficiency of
creating vast, diverse, and dynamic environments within a game world. 
The main objective is the utilization of procedural generation techniques, with Perlin Noise being central to
this approach due to its adaptability and natural-looking landscape generation. This noise
is used primarily for terrain generation, creating smooth, coherent landscapes that enhance
visual and exploratory appeal. Additionally, it aids in texture mapping, ensuring seamless
integration of textures into the environment. It also plays a crucial role in the placement
and variation of environmental elements like forests and rivers, contributing to a realistic
and immersive game world. In level design, it ensures each play-through is unique, by
generating interesting and varied game levels. This approach facilitates minimal manual
designing while crafting complex terrains, making it ideal for infinite game worlds. Perlin
Noiseâ€™s fine balance between randomness and consistency is essential for creating game
worlds that are both unpredictable and realistic, ensuring a new and unique experience
for the player in each session.
